# Pizza-Price-Prediction-App
In this App, We have built Pizza price predictor using Machine learning algorithms and later using Auto ML evalML.

# Introduction
Main Aim of this project is to predict the price of a Pizza based on different parameters like toppings and diameter etc, using 
Auto ML Techniques.

# Motivation
Imagine How cool it would be if you are able to predict the current prices of a pizza before the pizza tells you the actual price.

# Project Flow

1) Data Analysis - Finding out Different relations.

2) Feature Engineering - Processing the data before it feeding to the model.

3) Model Building using ML - Using ML/Dl Algorithms.

4) Model Building using Auto ML.
